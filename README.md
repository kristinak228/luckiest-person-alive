# luckiest-person-alive
This is a problem I found online that I wanted to implement in two ways: vectors and a linked list

The problem is this: the are n number of people in a circle, you kill the person adjacent to you, then pass the knife 
over one (to the next living person) until there is only 1 person left. For example, if n = 5

1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 | 1 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 | 1 --> 3 --> 5 | 3 --> 5 | 3
